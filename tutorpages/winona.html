          <h3>Program Lead</h3>

          <h4>Hello! I'm Winona and I'm a senior at Amador Valley High School. I'm one of the leads for this program and this is my third year in EEP. As a lead, I help with managing the program and communicating with our tutors and advisors. I wanted to join EEP in the first place because I wanted to gain some teaching experience as well as improve my Chinese. I look forward to working with all our tutors, advisors, and Taiwan students this year!</h3>
