          <h3>Curriculum Lead</h3>
          
          <h4>I'm Henry Chou, I'm a 10th grader at Foothill. I was a tutor last year and decided to continue this year because I think this program is a great opportunity for everyone. As we tutors get to learn how to teach and interact with a different culture of people while the students in Taiwan get to learn english. I'm also one of the curriculum leads who checks the lessons to make sure its suitable for the students.  </h3>
