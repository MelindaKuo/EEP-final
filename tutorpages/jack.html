          <h2>Jack Andrews</h2>
          <h3>Tutor</h3>

          <h4>My name is Jack. I'm a Freshman at Dougherty Valley High School. I have a sister named Kaitlyn, and a cat named Kiki who is 6 months old. I like reading, playing the violin, and having fun with my friends. I also like to hike and play soccer. I hope to get service hours and experience out of EEP towards the Presidential Volunteer Service Award. I also genuinely want to help students in Taiwan to learn better English and build stronger relationships. Thank you.</h3>
