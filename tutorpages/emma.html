          <h4>Hello! My name is Emma Wang and I'm currently a junior at Dublin High School. I wanted to return to EEP because of its impact on me the first time I joined. It has improved my Chinese speaking and it has improved my ability to hold a conversation with others in Chinese. I really liked the feeling it gave me after being a part of a student's language journey. Even if you don't know your student personally, you still develop a connection to them just by teaching them some basics with English!</h3>
