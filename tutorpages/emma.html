          <h2>Emma Wang</h2>
          <h3>Lead</h3>

          <h4>Hello! My name is Emma Wang and I'm currently a senior at Dublin High School and Iâ€™m a co-lead of this program. Being a lead, I help with managing the program and its tutors while making major decisions involving the longevity of this program. I wanted to return to EEP because of its impact on me the first time I joined. It has improved my Chinese speaking, it has improved my ability to hold a conversation with others Chinese, and my sociability overall. Being apart of a students journey of discovering another language and culture, maybe even discovering something about themselves, is a uniquely invaluable experience. Even if you don't know your student personally, you still develop a connection to them just by teaching them some basics with English!</h3>
