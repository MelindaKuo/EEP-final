          <h2>Katelyn Liu </h2>
          <h3>Tutor</h3>

          <h4>I'm in 10th Grade. My hobbies are drawing, reading books or comics, watching TV, and sometimes even gaming. I decided to join EEP in order to expand my capabilities of being able to act independently on my own, find ways to adapt to certain situations, and as well as to be able to try something new. During my time in EEP, I want to gain communication skills, quick problem-solving skills, and experience.</h3>
