          <h3>Tutor</h3>
          
          <h4>Hello! My name is Sophie Kao and I am a sophomore at Dublin High school!  I wanted to return as a tutor because my experience from last year introduced me to how to engage with younger students in lessons, and I wanted to dive deeper into that. It showed me that there was much more to communication in teaching. In addition, it taught me that teaching touched on more fundamentals than I expected. For example, building a relationship where the student is comfortable speaking. Overall, being capable of teaching a student, having them learn something new, is an unforgettable experience. </h3>
